# Experiential Foundations of My Playing Style 

This is a formularized system with considering variables to be worked out in a ball position.

These variables will nevertheless appear in various systems under different names.

| Variable | Description                                                                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `E`      | the spinning effect applied on cue ball                                                   |
| `D`      | departuring point on the base bank, connecting to cue ball or tangent point of cadre ball |
| `A`      | aimed point on first bank in contact with cue ball                                        |
| `F`      | finishing point on final bank before scoring (when lucky)                                 |
| `S`      | slicing point on carde ball where cue ball will travel on intended tangent line           |

#### Remarks
- Points of `D / A / F` are measured by diamonds along a bank
  - By defailt, corners are all 0, 1 diamond = 1 point
  - Unless explicitly stated in spcial systems
