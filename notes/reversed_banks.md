## Conditions

- Tendency towards corners (half of table)
- Follow through with natural to moderate-high speed

## Formulation

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `r` | attack (or reversed) point |
| `d` | point of cue-ball departure |
| `a` | arrival point (4th bank) |
| `o` | opening point per effect 1 / 2 / 4 |

Calculated by $r = o - d - a$, in which it follows

if reversed on long bank,
- $r$ - 0 (corner) / 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 (mid-table)
- $d$ - 0 (corner same side as $r$) / 10 / 20 / 30 (3rd diamond on short bank)
- $a$ - same as $d$
- $o$ - (based on $d$) 1~7.5 / 2~15 / 4~30

if reversed on short bank, those diamond points are halved.
